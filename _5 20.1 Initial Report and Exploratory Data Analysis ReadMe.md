20.1 Initial Report and Explanatory Data Analysis: Tax compliance data analysis 

Objective:
To analyze tax compliance data and predict price for 2025 using machine learning models. The goal was to evaluate the data for the years ended 2022 throught 2024 for various types of tax returns.  We evaluated various features (numerical and categorical) evaluating the correlation of what drives billings (Net production).  

Data Overview
The data is from Tax data pricing data set v2. with examples of 42,292

The classification goal is to predict the fees for a tax return in 2025.

Note: Data in #1 which represents the entire population
Dataset Size: 42,292 entries, 13 columns.
['clientid', 'jobid', 'WorkType', 'JobOffice', 'IndustryType', 'JobPartnerName', 'Year', 'Hours', 'LaborCost', 'Production', 'Expense', 'WO', 'NetProduction']

Features:

numerical_features = ['Hours', 'Production', 'LaborCost', 'Expense', 'WO', 'NetProduction']
categorical_features = ['clientid', 'jobid', 'Joboffice', 'IndustryType', 'WorkType', 'Year']
Target Variable: y (binary: yes, no).

Observations on Data and Model Evaluation

1. Data Observations
Preliminary analysis of the dataset revealed a considerable imbalance in the distribution of WorkTypes. For instance, 050 1040 Tax Compliance constituted 42.3% of the records, followed by 055 1065 Tax Compliance at 20.8%, and 051 1041 Tax Compliance at 12.9%. In contrast, several categories accounted for less than 1% of the data, including SALT Compliance and International Tax Compliance. Such disproportional representation suggests that model performance may be disproportionately influenced by the most prevalent categories, thereby limiting the generalizability of predictions across underrepresented groups.

2. Baseline Model Selection
Given that the dependent variable, NetProduction, is continuous in nature, a regression model was selected as the baseline analytical approach. Regression methods are particularly appropriate for tasks where the primary objective is to estimate numerical outcomes based on a set of explanatory variables.

3. Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the regression model was assessed using three widely adopted metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): 455,694.87

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 675.05

Coefficient of Determination (R²): 0.99

4. Justification for Metric Selection
The combination of error-based and variance-explained metrics provides a comprehensive evaluation of model performance. Specifically:

MSE and RMSE quantify the magnitude of prediction error, with RMSE offering a more interpretable value since it is expressed in the same units as NetProduction.

R² serves as a measure of explanatory power, indicating the proportion of variance in the dependent variable accounted for by the model. The inclusion of both error-based and variance-based metrics ensures that the evaluation captures both predictive accuracy and explanatory adequacy.

5. Interpretation of Findings
The model achieved an R² value of 0.99, indicating that 99% of the variability in NetProduction is explained by the predictors. The RMSE of 675.05 demonstrates that the model’s predictions deviate from observed values by approximately 675 units on average. Given that production values typically span several thousand units, this level of error may be considered relatively modest, thereby affirming the model’s predictive accuracy.

Application of the model to previously unseen data resulted in a predicted NetProduction of 1027.67, which falls within the expected range of outcomes. An examination of feature importance indicated that Production (0.88) was the most influential predictor, followed by WO (0.07) and Hours (0.01). Secondary variables, such as LaborCost and Expense, exhibited limited predictive influence. These findings suggest that output volume and billed work are the primary determinants of net production, while cost-related features play a more modest role.

6. Recommendations for additional considerations 
Several opportunities exist to enhance the robustness and generalizability of the model:

Mitigating WorkType Imbalance: Future studies should address the disproportionate representation of WorkTypes through strategies such as stratified sampling, reweighting, or oversampling of minority categories.

Validation Techniques: Employing k-fold cross-validation would provide stronger evidence that the observed R² is not an artifact of a particular train-test split.

Exploration of Alternative Models: Advanced regression methods, such as Gradient Boosted Trees, Random Forest Regression, or Elastic Net, may yield performance gains while providing varying levels of interpretability.

Feature Engineering: Introducing interaction terms or derived variables (e.g., combining Hours with LaborCost) could improve the model’s ability to capture nonlinear effects.

Residual Diagnostics: Further investigation of residual patterns across WorkTypes would help identify whether underrepresented categories are associated with higher prediction error, thereby informing targeted model refinements.

Conclusion
Overall, the baseline regression model demonstrated a strong ability to predict NetProduction, with high explanatory power and relatively low error margins. The results highlight the central role of production-related variables in determining outcomes, while also drawing attention to limitations posed by WorkType imbalance. These findings provide a robust foundation for further refinement through advanced modeling techniques, improved validation practices, and targeted handling of underrepresented categories.
